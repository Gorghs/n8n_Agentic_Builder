## 🚀 The Future of n8n Automation
**n8n Agentic Builder** is a elite-grade autonomous framework that bridges the gap between complex business logic and production-ready n8n workflows. Built for high-velocity engineers, this system utilizes specialized **Prompt-Engines** to architect, validate, and secure integrations in seconds.

### 💎 Core Intelligence Features
*   **🏗️ Autonomous Architecting**: Transmute natural language into sophisticated, multi-node n8n architectures instantly.
*   **🛡️ Ironclad Security**: Integrated **Security Architect** agents sweep for SSRF, Auth vulnerabilities, and PII leakage automatically.
*   **✅ Enterprise Compliance**: The **QA Compliance Engine** ensures every workflow follows the strict `verb-object` naming and error-handling standards.
*   **🌀 Pattern Synthesis**: Curates and adapts templates for seamless reuse across diverse infrastructure.

## 🛠️ The Local "Addon" Engine
Forget manual imports. This builder operates as a **Native Protocol Addon** to your orchestration environment.

1.  **Initialize the Core**: 
    ```bash
    # Activate the Agentic Protocols
    ./initialize_builder.sh --mode=active
    ```
2.  **Engage the Neural Link**:
    Sync the `prompts/` directory to your terminal agent. The agents are now primed as high-performance workflow engineers.
3.  **Autonomous Synthesis**:
    Simply describe your vision. The **Build Captain** interprets and synthesizes directly into your `workflows/` directory.
4.  **Protocol Deployment**:
    Workflows are ready for immediate activation within the n8n ecosystem via the automated CLI bridge.
